# Portfolio

Welcome to my data analyst portfolio! I'm passionate about leveraging data to uncover insights and drive informed decision-making. With a background in computer Science Engineering and Administration, I specialize in programs like office 365, GSuite, RStudio, Tableau and Power BI.

In each project showcased here, I will strive to demonstrate my analytical skills, attention to detail and ability to communicate complex findings in a clear and compelling manner. Whether it's cleaning messy datasets, building predictive models, or crafting intuitive data visualizations, I'm dedicated to delivering actionable insights that empower organizations to thrive in today's data-driven world.

Outside of data analysis, I enjoy coding and playing with numbers. I'm always eager to collaborate on new projects or discuss opportunities, so feel free to reach out!

Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of data together. ðŸš€
